# SepsisPredictor-ML

## Description
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for early detection and classification of sepsis from patient data. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models, we aim to provide a tool that enhances healthcare providers' decision-making processes.
