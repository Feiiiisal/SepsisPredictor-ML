# SepsisPredictor-ML

## Description
In the realm of healthcare, timely and accurate diagnosis is critical. My project, SepsisPredictor-ML, leverages machine learning to develop a model that aids in the detection and classification of sepsis from patient data. This tool is designed to enhance decision-making processes for healthcare providers, making it a valuable asset in medical settings.
